Jobs Dasboard
=============

The aim of the project is to build a one page dashboard, where users can login and perform a number of basic functions. Users can only modify the records they have created, whilst the admin can modify any data from any user.

Data is displayed on a one-page dashboard in a list form. The list updates automatically every 10 seconds using an AJAX request. For the purpose of the assignment, the list can update in its entirety (you do not need to pull only new information).

When selecting each job, you should be able to edit the job information (if your permissions allow) or add notes to the job (anyone can add notes to any job). Each note should show the name of the user who added it, along with the time.
